# Bot Pattern Library

This is a project to collect and document a set of design patterns for conversational user interfaces that can be used by bot developers to build better bots.

Much like [a pattern library for GUI software](http://styleguides.io/examples.html), this project will contain reference designs for frequently used elements that occur in conversations with bots. This should include things like conversational patterns for input validation, different types of questions and answers, and on-boarding best practices.
