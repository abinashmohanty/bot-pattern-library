# Some patterns we think we should capture

* Onboarding
* Help command
* Bot introducing itself
* Association between bot and user -- setting name, linking accounts
* Patterns for passive listening -- when the bot hears patterns or triggers 
* Patterns for active listening -- when the bot is invoked directly
* Patterns for when the bot responds to external information and events
* Basic input primitives - yes/no questions, pick from a list, multiple choice, multi-line input
* Patterns for disambiguating unclear input


And also...

* Combinations of these things that can define _types of bots_
